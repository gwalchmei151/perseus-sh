## _C2 Course - SOC Project_  

More Info: https://www.centreforcybersecurity.com/programmes

_Objective:
Create a script that runs different cyber attacks in a given network to check if monitoring alerts appear_

_Functions:_
_- Install relevant applications on the computer_
_- Execute network scans and attacks_
_- Save into a log all of the activities executed by code_

# Perseus.sh
A script that examines the network to find machines, and gives the user the option to use nmap or masscan, and then execute a variety of attacks on the target. Two versions - one for those that haven't made lolcat executable from PATH

## When script starts
Check if executed by Root user, otherwise issue reminder and quit:

Check if perseus_logs  folder exists in /var/log. If it doesnâ€™t create it.

Then proceed to welcome screen

Check for missing programmes and ask for permission to install:

## Scan Phase

Into main script after installation of missing programmes

![img5](./images/img5.png)

OR into main script without installation if necessary programmes present

![img6](./images/img6.png)

Scanning message

![img7](./images/img7.png)

Enumerate Hosts on network and generate list to choose target OR Enter target manually.
Then choose desired scan method - nmap or masscan.

## Masscan
Choose first and last ports to set range

![img9](./images/img9.png)

Discovered ports will be listed and programme will ask for follow-up action

![img10](./images/img10.png)

## Nmap
Script will automatically ``` nmap -A``` the target

![img11](./images/img11.png)

Discovered information (ports, protocols, services, and versions) will be displayed to the user

## Brute Force SSH

### Through Masscan

![img13](./images/img13.png)

List successfull credentials and exit

![img14](./images/img14.png)

### Through Nmap

![img15](./images/img15.png)

## Kerberos Enum (msfconsole)

### Through Nmap

![img16](./images/img65.png)

Enter information to create msfconsole resource file

![img17](./images/img17.png)

Example msfconsole output

![img18](./images/img18.png)

### Kerberos service not detected, manual port entry (for example if masscan is used instead of nmap):

![img19](./images/img19.png)

Kerberos not detected since masscan did not do service detection. Enter other information as per usual. The rest of the results are the same as above .
